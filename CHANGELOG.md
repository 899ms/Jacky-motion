# Changelog

## 2.2.0 - 2026-09-15

- Unified the manual HTML and SRT autoplay workflows behind one Jacky Motion entry point.
- Synced the current 16:9 and 3:4 visual core, including portrait layout skeletons and the `paper-craft-studio` style.
- Kept one shared set of seven style, layout, motion, and visual quality rules; SRT now adds only timing, autoplay, and B-roll behavior.
- Added dedicated SRT runtime and validation filenames to prevent standard and timed outputs from using the wrong checker.
- Added a curated gallery of real browser-verified outputs for GitHub and marketplace presentation.
- Updated repository documentation, mode routing, installation examples, and public-facing metadata.

## 2.1.0 - 2026-07-20

- Upgraded the skill to the independent Jacky Motion 2.0 SRT automatic-recording workflow.
- Added SRT parsing and made subtitle timestamps the single source of truth for beat and step timing.
- Added a fourth confirmation gate for locking motion, step, and B-roll coverage before HTML assembly.
- Added automatic fullscreen startup, a three-second countdown, pause/resume, five-second seeking, and deterministic replay.
- Added first-class B-roll beats with titled recording frames for intervals that should show real product footage.
- Extended static and browser validation for time coverage, overlaps, gaps, and autoplay state.
- Fixed stretched `paper-collage` kicker labels by making them hug their text content inside Grid and Flex layouts.
